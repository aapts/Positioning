%(xn yn) and every anchor would be as close as possible to the original known 
%distances. To evaluate such a point, we create a functional vector with 
%differences of distances between points and anchors.

%function accepts the struct field of problem parameters, an array of beacons and the
%array of original known distances. 
%optional: define the start point of the minimizer search. 
%If not passed to the function, defaults to [0 0]
